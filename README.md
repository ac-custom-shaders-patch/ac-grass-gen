## About

Original Codemasters presentation about grass ([link](http://blog.codemasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rendering-Fields-of-Grass-using-DirectX11-in-GRID-Autosport.pdf)) 
had an example of their grass texture. I couldn’t find a good way to hand paint a texture like that, so I made a small generator for a 
similar looking grass. Everything is very primitive, but I believe it produces compatible result.

## Usage

Simply run EXE-file and it’ll create a new “generated” folder nearby with 16 separate grass textures and an atlas of 16 images.
